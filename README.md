HI There welcome over 
I know many  people think web development is hard or whatever is your mind set 
But this readme file is just made to guide you on how to make page of your device page
format is fixed you cant do any changes in it so just follow insturctions

I have mentioned below which line and what changes you have to make 
make those changes and add pull request so that file will be merged and linked 
to website if everything is fine

1) create a duplicate file of "Sample.html" which is saved  in folder 
	"offical devices" rename the duplicate file according to your device name 
    for example you can take nokia phones and file should be place in offical-device folder only of your devices

2) got o line no 48,49,50 fill them has asked  
3) on line no 51  insetr telegram group link between " " 
4) add pull request for merge for your device to be listed on website
