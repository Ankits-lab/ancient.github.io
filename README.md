HI There welcome over 
I know many people web development is hard or whatever is your mind set 
But this readme file is just made to guide on how to make page of your page
format is fixed you cant do any changes in it so just follow insturctions

I have mentioned below which line and what changes you have to make 
make those changes and add pull request so that file will merged and linked 
to website if everything is fine

1) create a duplicate file of "Nokia 6.1" which is saved under name "nokia6-1.html"
    in folder "offical devices" rename the duplicate file according to your device name 
    for example you can take nokia phones and file should be place in offical-device folder only of your devices

2) now go to line no 153 replace NOKIA PHONE NAME WITH YOURS AND ITS CODE NAME AS WELL
3) now go to line 158 & 159 AND REPLACE NOKIA 6.1 WITH YOUR PHONE NAME &&
    also change link telegram group to your device telegram group

4) so from line no 164 to 175 are installtion instruction so replace installtion 
    instruction for rom has per your phones
5) Dowload link is common on line no 180 (warn do not change it can only by core team devs or myself :- Ankit kene)
